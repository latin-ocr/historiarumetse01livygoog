The text of Drakenborch has been adopted, as, on the
whole, ol the.. highest authority; but, Livy b'eing the author
first read in gur Colleges, care has been taken to conform the
orthography ol those words which may be variously written,
to the Dictionaries and'Grammars in common use. With a
similar regard to the condition os newly formed classes,
necessarily consisting of individuale of different degrees ol
proficiency, certain ambiguous words are distinguished by
accents3 but studente should beccum accustomed to dispense
with these facilities in some part of their course, sor modern
editions of the classice rarely afford them*

Mirller, Deering, and Ruperti, fill as much space as could well

word of the same spelling is of vcr frequent occurrence, the accent is
omitted, e. g. srttis, magis, sepe. “ (loncscet syllables are marked with
a circumflex3 also the final syllable of the ablative of the first deelon·
sion,” und this (contrary to Ruddiman) even when the governing prepo-
siticn is expressed.
