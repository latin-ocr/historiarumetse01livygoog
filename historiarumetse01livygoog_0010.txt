 

PREFACE.

'I'nrs selection from the History of Livy is published with
particular reference to those Colleges and higher schooh,
iu which the first Five Books have hitherto formed a part
of the course of Latin studies, The editor, by his expe·
rience as an instructer in Harvard University, was led
to observa that the volume in common use, though it con-
tains some of the linest passages of this writer, is yet in
great part uninteresting to young studente. Το such, many
of the details, which are necessary to the complcteness of
Ἰ the Roman annals, prove wearisomc from their similnrity,
if not from their wantos importance. And to say nothing
of the injustice done to the author by taking arbitrarily
the first five books of a History of infinite variety, and con·
sisting‚ as he wrote it, of at least one hundred and sorty
books (from thirty-five of ¹which we still have a choice),
justice is thus hardly rendered to those who may never have
an opportunity to read more of the work thau is compre ⁰
hended in their early studies, or whose reading of the whole
may depend on the impressiou given by this part.

Until he had principally made this selection, the editor
was unable to lcarn that any book, having the same object,
had been published, nor is he yet aware that any such is
iu use in Great Britain or in the South of Europe; but the
kindness of friends has furnished him with two, published
in Germany in the course of the· last century* Os these,
