prepared with so good judgment as the other, which is
accompanic'd by notes, generally in Latin, but sometimes
in German. All the extracta in the later one are to be
found also in the present volume, besides others which the
purpose os the selection seemed equally to require. The
propriety of giving the First Book entire will be obvious to
all who consider how osten the subject of it is alluded to,
both in ancient and modern literature; while, with regard
to the remainder of the volume, the world has been too long
agreed as to what are masterpieces, to leave any doubt about
the absolute excellence of the particular passages chosen, or
